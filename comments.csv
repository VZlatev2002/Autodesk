1,ryan.bales,"Something isn't right, you only have the option to open. Is this project on your personal hub?"
2,euanwmcgill,"Yes, I am using the free Personal plan. That shouldn't restrict inserting components though should it?"
3,ryan.bales,Is this project on YOUR hub or personal license or are you invited to it? If so that would restrict the ability to do anything but open as it falls under collaboration.
4,euanwmcgill,"Ah yes I see what you mean now. Yes this is on my personal hub, I created the files"
5,ryan.bales,"And just to be clear, you are inserting File A into File B and BOTH reside in the Garden Office project?"
6,euanwmcgill,If it makes any difference I am running 2.0.6516 on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. I think this may be the first time that I have tried to insert a component since the subscription type change in October

9,TrippyLighting,"Please create a screencast of the behavior. I do this many times throughout each day and (2017 15"" MacBook Pro, still on Big Sur) and have not encountered such problems."

11,TrippyLighting,"If you want to do CAD on a mac, my strong suggestion would be to get yourself a good mouse with 2-buttons and a scroll-click wheel."
12,DaveGadgeteer,"So, I request that AutoDesk give some priority to fixing this long-overlooked trivial bug. That's all I'm asking."
13,Phil.E,
14,TrippyLighting,I can see that for long-time mac users who are used to this functionality this behavior is puzzling.

17,Phil.E,"The biggest difference between my machine and yours, between my clicks and yours, at this point, is your trackpad settings. Thanks in advance for taking your time to show me. I'm very happy to use any information you provide to test and improve the product. I'm sort of stuck here without the ability to do what you are doing."
18,andrewDXQZ3,"@Phil.E,Â I am running into a similar problem. My issue is that i can secondary click to insert in current design and it works, but drag to insert won't work. I'm on a mac platform. Is this just something that is not supported on mac or a setting I need to turn on etc."
